---

Hands-on projects for system and network monitoring, traffic inspection, and SOC workflows, providing practical experience in alert analysis and operational visibility.

---

## Areas of Focus

- Command-line usage in operational environments  
- Log searching, filtering, and basic analysis  
- File system structure and data organization  
- Network traffic visibility, routing, and VLAN concepts  
- Writing clear, repeatable technical documentation

## Projects

### **Linux CLI (SOC-Focused)** [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/CataCsas/Linux_CLI)

A collection of Linux command-line exercises and scenarios based on tasks commonly encountered during system inspection and security operations, including log analysis, file system navigation, package management, and basic network monitoring using tools such as `tcpdump` and Suricata.

### **Enterprise Homelab** [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/CataCsas/enterprise-homelab)

Enterprise-style home lab designed to support SOC workflows such as system and network monitoring, alert analysis, and investigation. The environment emphasizes **network segmentation, security telemetry, and controlled traffic flows** using:

- **Netgate SG-2100** — pfSense edge firewall, inter-VLAN routing, and DHCP  
- **Cisco Catalyst WS-C3560CX-8PC-S** — access-layer switching, VLAN segmentation, and trunking  

> Notes: Inter-VLAN routing and DHCP are handled centrally on pfSense. Cisco provides VLAN access enforcement, trunking, and basic L2 connectivity. This design reflects enterprise-style practices and prioritizes operational visibility for SOC-aligned workflows.
