# Enterprise Homelab

This repository documents the design and evolution of an enterprise-style home lab focused on **network segmentation, security monitoring, and SOC-aligned operational practices**.

The lab simulates real-world enterprise infrastructure with an emphasis on clear architecture, controlled traffic flows, and visibility into system and network activity.

Hands-on exercises demonstrate practical experience in alert analysis, administrative control validation, and operational visibility.

---

## Lab Overview

The environment is built using:

- **Netgate SG-2100** as pfSense edge firewall, inter-VLAN router, DHCP, and perimeter control  
- **Cisco Catalyst WS-C3560CX-8PC-S** for VLAN segmentation, trunking, and access-layer enforcement  
- **VLAN-based segmentation** to separate users, infrastructure, IoT, and guest traffic  
- **Wazuh SIEM (Linux-based)** for centralized log collection, alerting, and security monitoring  

Core infrastructure uses static IPs to ensure stable routing, predictable firewall policies, and consistent log ingestion.

The lab emphasizes **architectural decisions, security rationale, and operational discipline** aligned with SOC workflows.

---

## Goals and Scope

This lab is intended to:

- Practice **enterprise-style network segmentation**
- Develop familiarity with **security telemetry and log analysis**
- Support **incident detection, investigation, and response concepts**
- Maintain clear, repeatable technical documentation

As the environment evolves, changes are documented with an emphasis on clarity, traceability, and operational relevance.

<summary>Status</summary>

### Infrastructure

- Static IP assignment for core infrastructure (pfSense, Cisco management, SIEM)  
- Wired VLAN segmentation (Management, Security, Users, Printers)  
- Stateful firewall policy with restricted inter-VLAN access  
- Dedicated Security VLAN (VLAN20) for SIEM monitoring  

### Security Monitoring

- Wazuh installed and operational on VLAN20  
- Log ingestion validated from `/var/log/auth.log`  
- Alert correlation and rule validation confirmed  

### Cloud Exercises (Completed)

- **[Lab 01 – Microsoft Entra ID: User Creation and RBAC](./cloud/01-azure-ad-users.md)**
  - Created three users simulating enterprise roles (Admin, Security Operator, Guest/Auditor)  
  - Assigned roles using **least-privilege principle** and validated tenant-level MFA enforcement  
  - Documented rationale, role assignments, and observations for portfolio review  

- **[Lab 02 – Azure AD Identity Hardening](./cloud/02-azure-ad-identity-hardening.md)**
  - Reviewed administrative posture and implemented emergency access planning  
  - Restricted default tenant behaviors including app registration and group creation  
  - Validated changes via audit logs to ensure traceability and governance

### Detection Case Studies (Completed)

- **[Detection Case 01 – Failed Sudo Escalation](./security/detection-cases/01-sudo-failure.md)**
  - Validated Rule 5503 (authentication failure)  
  - Correlated escalation to Rule 5404 (three failed sudo attempts)  
  - Documented SOC triage workflow

- **[Detection Case 02 – Scripted Persistence Simulation](./security/detection-cases/02-scripted-persistence.md)**
  - Simulated account creation and privilege escalation  
  - Validated File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) for `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/group`  
  - Detected cron-based persistence creation  
  - Captured structured `alerts.json` snapshot for reconstruction

### Operational Documentation

- VLAN20 DNS/NTP connectivity incident documented  
- Firewall rule refinement recorded with remediation steps  
- Change management and lessons learned updated  
- **Jira Service Management lab exercise documented**  
  - Simulated ITSM workflow, incident triage, service requests, and resolution  
  - See [`01-jira-service-management.md`](./operations/01-jira-service-management.md) for full details and screenshots
